        <h1>About Cebu City</h1>

        <p>
            Cebu, a province in the Philippines, derives its name from “Sibu,” meaning “trade.” Before Spanish colonization, Cebu was a major trading hub, engaging with merchants from China, Malaysia, Japan, and India. It had an organized society led by datus, with communities structured into barangays. The people, known as pintados for their tattoos, lived in wooden houses and practiced a system where labor was based on kinship rather than slavery.

            In 1521, Ferdinand Magellan arrived in Cebu and converted Rajah Humabon’s community to Christianity, but he was later killed by Lapulapu in Mactan. Cebu remained independent until 1566 when Miguel López de Legazpi established Spanish rule, leading to the construction of Catholic churches, watchtowers, and schools. Economic and cultural changes followed, but Spanish abuses and economic decline fueled resistance.

            Cebu played a role in the Philippine Revolution of 1898, but American forces soon took control, leading to the Philippine-American War. The province later experienced World War II, Japanese occupation, post-war reconstruction, and Philippine independence. Through centuries of change, Cebuanos have remained resilient, hardworking, and culturally rich, making Cebu a significant historical and economic center in the country.
